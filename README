Simple server that includes CORS headers to the HTML resource served at `/hello`.  Url is `http://localhost:3000/hello` by default
```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# start the server
npm start
```

The server will start on port 3000 by default.  This can be overriden using the `PORT` environment variable.  (e.g. `PORT=8080 npm start`)

The server will add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4502` by default.  The origin can be changed using the `ALLOW_ORIGIN` environment variable.  (e.g. ALLOW_ORIGIN=http://somehost.com npm start`)
